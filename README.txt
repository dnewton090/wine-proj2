# Welcome to the South East Wines e-Commerce site! 

## Rapid Web Development final project - QUT

##Purpose of the application:
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

This site provides the functionality of browsing through categories as well as individual bottles of wine,
 with interactive links that will take you further into a product categories page, product details page as well as a shopping cart & checkout page. 

We use a sessionID to both track items in the shopping cart, and interface with the database. 

Installation packages & dependencies can be found in the pip_freeze.txt file in the folder directory. 

Navigable HTML pages for the user include index, order, winecategory/<winecategory>, detail/<productid> as well as checkout file.

The site is intended to showcase Jinja2 templating, Flask-WTForms, Flask-SQLAlchemy as well as Flask Blueprints for page routing.  
- Routes can be inspected in the views.py file. 

Future iterations intend on adding interactive capabilities using a front-end JS framework. 

ENJOY BROWSING SE WINE'S VINO PRODUCTS!
