# WTForms do a lot of the heavy lifting in validation & CSRF
# Flask-WTF maps form into an object, that can be used in Python OOP
from flask_wtf import FlaskForm
from wtforms.fields import SubmitField, StringField
from wtforms.validators import InputRequired, email

# FlaskForm represents the form as an Class â€“ better OOP practise
